# üß© Tilebreakers

**Tilebreakers** is a minimalist, single-player, color-and-number merge puzzle game built with **Unity 2D**. Swipe, merge, split, and trigger special abilities to manage the board and rack up the highest score‚Äîbefore it fills up.

## üéÆ Gameplay Overview

- **Click tiles** to select and move them up to their number value in any direction.
- **Merge same-colored tiles** to add their numbers together.
- **Split** tiles when the value exceeds 12 into random tiles that total the original.
- **Special tiles** spawn from splits and trigger game-changing abilities.
- **New tiles** appear after every move.
- **Game ends** when the board is full and no valid moves remain.

## üß© Level System ‚Äì LevelManager & LevelData

Even though Tilebreakers is designed as an endless puzzle game, introducing a level system opens the door for:

- Structured challenge levels
- Difficulty progression (e.g., increased color count, limited moves)
- Campaigns or milestones
- Special modifiers (e.g., faster split threshold, spawn blockers)
- Daily rotating objectives

---

### üìÅ Files

#### `Core/LevelManager.cs`
Manages current level rules, objectives, and win/loss conditions.

```csharp
public class LevelManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public static LevelManager Instance;
    public LevelData currentLevel;

    private void Awake()
    {
        if (Instance == null) Instance = this;
        else Destroy(gameObject);
    }

    public void LoadLevel(LevelData level)
    {
        currentLevel = level;
        // Apply settings: grid size, rules, special tile toggle
    }

    public bool IsLevelComplete()
    {
        // Evaluate score, move count, etc.
        return false;
    }

    public void AdvanceToNextLevel()
    {
        // Load next LevelData or return to menu
    }
}
```

---

#### `Core/LevelData.cs` (ScriptableObject)

Holds data for each level ‚Äî easily configured in the Unity Inspector.

```csharp
[CreateAssetMenu(menuName = "Tilebreakers/Level")]
public class LevelData : ScriptableObject
{
    public int gridSizeX = 6;
    public int gridSizeY = 6;
    public int startingTileCount = 4;
    public int scoreTarget;
    public int maxMoves;
    public bool allowSpecialTiles = true;
    public bool isTimed;
    public List<Vector2Int> predefinedTilePositions;
}
```

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Plan

1. Create `LevelData.cs` as a ScriptableObject.
2. Create a few test levels in `Assets/Levels/` (e.g., `Level_01.asset`, `DailyChallenge.asset`).
3. Create `LevelManager.cs` to control level loading and progression.
4. Update `GameManager` to reference `LevelManager.Instance.currentLevel` on start.
5. Pass rules to `BoardManager`, `TileSpawner`, and `GameStateManager` (e.g., disallow special tiles).
6. Add condition evaluation:
   - Score threshold reached
   - Number of moves used
   - Win/loss popup

---

### üß† Optional Extensions

- Add "Next Level" button after win
- Tie `LevelData` to a challenge or daily rotation system
- Add `LevelObjective.cs` for complex conditions (e.g., "Merge 5 red tiles")

---

## üß± Basic Full Game Build ‚Äì Checklist (Pre-State System)

Before implementing advanced systems like GameStateManager and LevelManager, the goal is to build a complete, minimal version of the game with all core logic, UI, and interactions functioning. This version can be playtested and expanded safely.

### ‚úÖ Core Gameplay Loop
- [x] Tile movement: click to select and move tile up to its number of spaces
- [x] Merge logic: same-colored tiles merge and add their numbers
- [x] Split logic: if value > 12, split into smaller tiles summing to the original
- [x] Random tile spawn after each move
- [x] Prevent movement into occupied cells
- [ ] Game over check: board full and no valid merges
- [ ] Restart button resets the board

---

### ‚úÖ Basic UI Elements
- [ ] Score display (merges and splits)
- [ ] Game over screen with:
  - Final score
  - Restart button
- [ ] Optional: simple pause button
- [ ] Visual indicator for selected tile
- [ ] Optional: debug UI (current tile state, move log)

---

### ‚úÖ Basic Visuals and Feedback
- [ ] Basic tile color and number rendering
- [ ] Merge animation (e.g. scale bounce)
- [ ] Tile move animation
- [ ] Split animation (simple spawn pop)

---

### üîÅ Once Complete:
- Playtest for game balance, bugs, and feel
- Add GameStateManager to organize logic
- Layer in special tiles, polish, effects, and UI improvements
