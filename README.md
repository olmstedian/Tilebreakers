# Tilebreakers

## Overview
Tilebreakers is a tile-matching puzzle game where players merge and manipulate tiles on a grid. The game combines elements of classic puzzle games with strategic gameplay, requiring players to plan their moves carefully to maximize their score.

## Features
- **Tile Merging**: Merge tiles of the same color to increase their value
- **Move Mechanics**: Move tiles across the grid based on their number value
- **Visual Highlighting System**: Different highlight colors for movement options (blue) and merge targets (gold)
- **Special Tiles**: Utilize special tiles with unique abilities:
  - **Blaster**: Destroys adjacent tiles in a 3x3 area
  - **Freeze**: Skips the next tile spawn
  - **Doubler**: Doubles the value of adjacent tiles
  - **Painter**: Changes the color of adjacent tiles to match
- **Tile Splitting**: Large-value tiles automatically split into multiple smaller tiles when exceeding a threshold
- **Level Progression**: Multiple levels with increasing difficulty
- **Score System**: Earn points by merging and manipulating tiles

## How to Play
1. Select a tile to see possible moves highlighted in blue and possible merges highlighted in gold
2. Move tiles to empty spaces or merge with same-color tiles
3. Plan strategically to create high-value merges and utilize special tiles
4. Progress through levels by reaching the target score

## Controls
- **Mouse/Touch**: Click/tap to select a tile, then click/tap again to move or merge
- **Special Tiles**: Click directly on special tiles to activate their abilities

## Development
This game is developed in Unity and uses a state-based architecture for game flow management. The project includes a modular design with separate components for:
- Tile management
- Board management
- Game state control
- Special tile abilities
- Visual effects and animations

## Recent Updates
- Added Painter special tile that changes adjacent tiles to its color
- Improved visual highlighting system to distinguish between move targets (blue) and merge targets (gold)
- Enhanced tile splitting logic with better positioning and color assignment
- Added weighted randomization for special tile spawning
- Fixed bugs related to tile merging and board management

---

## üß© Level System ‚Äì LevelManager & LevelData

Even though Tilebreakers is designed as an endless puzzle game, introducing a level system opens the door for:

- Structured challenge levels
- Difficulty progression (e.g., increased color count, limited moves)
- Campaigns or milestones
- Special modifiers (e.g., faster split threshold, spawn blockers)
- Daily rotating objectives

---

### üìÅ Files

#### `Core/LevelManager.cs`
Manages current level rules, objectives, and win/loss conditions.

```csharp
public class LevelManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public static LevelManager Instance;
    public LevelData currentLevel;

    private void Awake()
    {
        if (Instance == null) Instance = this;
        else Destroy(gameObject);
    }

    public void LoadLevel(LevelData level)
    {
        currentLevel = level;
        // Apply settings: grid size, rules, special tile toggle
    }

    public bool IsLevelComplete()
    {
        // Evaluate score, move count, etc.
        return false;
    }

    public void AdvanceToNextLevel()
    {
        // Load next LevelData or return to menu
    }
}
```

---

#### `Core/LevelData.cs` (ScriptableObject)

Holds data for each level ‚Äî easily configured in the Unity Inspector.

```csharp
[CreateAssetMenu(menuName = "Tilebreakers/Level")]
public class LevelData : ScriptableObject
{
    public int gridSizeX = 6;
    public int gridSizeY = 6;
    public int startingTileCount = 4;
    public int scoreTarget;
    public int maxMoves;
    public bool allowSpecialTiles = true;
    public bool isTimed;
    public List<Vector2Int> predefinedTilePositions;
}
```

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Plan

1. Create `LevelData.cs` as a ScriptableObject.
2. Create a few test levels in `Assets/Levels/` (e.g., `Level_01.asset`, `DailyChallenge.asset`).
3. Create `LevelManager.cs` to control level loading and progression.
4. Update `GameManager` to reference `LevelManager.Instance.currentLevel` on start.
5. Pass rules to `BoardManager`, `TileSpawner`, and `GameStateManager` (e.g., disallow special tiles).
6. Add condition evaluation:
   - Score threshold reached
   - Number of moves used
   - Win/loss popup

---

### üß† Optional Extensions

- Add "Next Level" button after win
- Tie `LevelData` to a challenge or daily rotation system
- Add `LevelObjective.cs` for complex conditions (e.g., "Merge 5 red tiles")

---

## üß± Basic Full Game Build ‚Äì Checklist (Pre-State System)

Before implementing advanced systems like GameStateManager and LevelManager, the goal is to build a complete, minimal version of the game with all core logic, UI, and interactions functioning. This version can be playtested and expanded safely.

### ‚úÖ Core Gameplay Loop
- [x] Tile movement: click to select and move tile up to its number of spaces
- [x] Merge logic: same-colored tiles merge and add their numbers
- [x] Split logic: if value > 12, split into smaller tiles summing to the original
- [x] Random tile spawn after each move
- [x] Prevent movement into occupied cells
- [ ] Game over check: board full and no valid merges
- [ ] Restart button resets the board

---

### ‚úÖ Basic UI Elements
- [ ] Score display (merges and splits)
- [ ] Game over screen with:
  - Final score
  - Restart button
- [ ] Optional: simple pause button
- [ ] Visual indicator for selected tile
- [ ] Optional: debug UI (current tile state, move log)

---

### ‚úÖ Basic Visuals and Feedback
- [ ] Basic tile color and number rendering
- [ ] Merge animation (e.g. scale bounce)
- [ ] Tile move animation
- [ ] Split animation (simple spawn pop)

---

### üîÅ Once Complete:
- Playtest for game balance, bugs, and feel
- Add GameStateManager to organize logic
- Layer in special tiles, polish, effects, and UI improvements

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Scenes & Game States

A full implementation of Tilebreakers will include multiple Unity scenes and a well-defined set of game states to handle transitions and logic flow clearly and scalably.
