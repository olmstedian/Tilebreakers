## üìÖ Previous Updates

### **[Date: 2025-03-26]**
#### **Tile Enhancements**
- Added dynamic brightness to tiles based on their number for better visual hierarchy.

- Added animations:
  - Smooth spawn animation for tiles.
  - Pulse animation for merges.
  - Smooth movement animations for tile transitions.

#### **Grid and Cell Improvements**
- Updated grid background to use a uniform light gray color.
- Enhanced cell indicators with subtle scaling and layering for better clarity.

#### **Board Management**
- Created `BoardManager` to manage grid state, tile placement, and updates.
- Added methods for:
  - Initializing the grid.
  - Generating random starting tiles.
  - Managing empty cells and prioritized spawn locations.

#### **Tile Logic**
- Developed `Tile` class with:
